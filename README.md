Computer science's classification of human emotions in multimedia data streams is a vital and rapidly developing subject. 
The problem of emotion classification has enormous potential for application in a wide variety of industries, including robotics, tracking systems, and 
other systems that engage with the user interactively (for example, call centers, smart homes, or various assistant applications). 
Solving this challenge enables the user to provide input inherently, without forcing the user to do any additional steps, hence simplifying
and speeding up human-computer interaction and bringing computer solutions closer to human solutions.
